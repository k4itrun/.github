## Our Commitment

As project members and contributors, we are dedicated to fostering a positive, harassment-free, and inclusive environment for people of all backgrounds and identities. We strive to make participation a genuinely welcoming experience for everyone.

## Guidelines for Interaction

To help maintain a friendly and productive space, we ask everyone to:

- Treat others with respect, empathy, and patience
- Value diverse opinions, experiences, and perspectives
- Offer constructive and thoughtful feedback
- Own up to mistakes and learn from them
- Focus on collaboration and the well-being of the community as a whole

### Behaviors that are not acceptable include:

- Harassment, threats, or discrimination of any kind
- Sexually explicit or offensive language/images
- Personal attacks, insults, or trolling
- Sharing others’ private information without consent
- Any other conduct that makes others feel unsafe or unwelcome

## Leadership Responsibilities

Our maintainers and moderators are empowered to interpret and enforce these guidelines. They may edit, remove, or reject any content or contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will explain moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Where This Applies

This Code of Conduct is in effect across all our community spaces—repositories, issue trackers, chats, and any events or public representation of the project.

## Reporting Concerns

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, please report it privately to the maintainers at <tsx@billoneta.xyz>. All reports will be reviewed with care and confidentiality.

## Consequences

Depending on the nature and severity of the violation, actions may include:

- A private warning or request for a public apology
- Temporary or permanent removal from community spaces
- Restriction or revocation of participation privileges

Our goal is to ensure a safe and welcoming space for everyone; repeated or severe violations will result in escalated actions.
